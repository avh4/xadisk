 * This exception is thrown by the various I/O methods in {@link XADiskBasicIOOperations}
 * when an attempt to acquire required locks (over file/directory objects) could not succeed
 * because one of the ancestors (parent directory, parent's parent directory, and further)
 * of the corresponding files/directories has been "pinned" by some other transaction. A
 * Pin is a special kind of lock over a directory which is acquired by a transaction
 * willing to {@link XADiskBasicIOOperations#moveFile(java.io.File, java.io.File) move}
 * the directory.
 * <p> As of XADisk 1.0, no wait is done for release of the pin on the ancestor directory, and this
 * exception is thrown immediately. (<i>Such waiting would be implemented in upcoming releases.</i>)
