/**
 * This exception is a subclass of {@link NoTransactionAssociatedException} and can
 * be thrown when a method call (in {@link Session}, {@link XASession}, {@link XADiskBasicIOOperations},
 * {@link XAFileInputStream}, {@link XAFileOutputStream} or {@link XADiskUserLocalTransaction})
 * was expecting an associated transaction, but such a transaction has already been rolled-back
 * by XADisk System.
 * <p> Such a situation may result when:
 * <ol>
 * <li> the current transaction has been already rolled-back by XADisk system due
 * to transaction time out.
 * <li> the current transaction gets rolled-back by XADisk system during the method call
 * itself (e.g. this transaction was involved in a deadlock and was rolled-back by XADisk system
 * to remedy the deadlock. See {@link DeadLockVictimizedException}).
 * </ol>
 * 
 * <p> For every exception of this class, there is always an associated cause; this cause
 * is usually {@link DeadLockVictimizedException} or {@link TransactionTimeoutException}.
