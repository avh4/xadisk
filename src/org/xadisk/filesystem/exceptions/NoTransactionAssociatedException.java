/**
 * This exception is thrown by various methods in {@link Session},
 * {@link XASession}, {@link XADiskBasicIOOperations}, {@link XAFileInputStream},
 * {@link XAFileOutputStream} and {@link XADiskUserLocalTransaction}
 * when an associated (<i>current</i>) transaction was expected, but there is no such transaction.
 * <p> Such a situation may result when:
 * <ol>
 * <li> the current transaction has been explicitly rolled-back or committed earlier by the client
 * <li> the current transaction has been already rolled-back by XADisk system due
 * to transaction time out.
 * <li> the current transaction gets rolled-back by XADisk system during the method call
 * itself (e.g. this transaction was involved in a deadlock and was rolled-back by XADisk system
 * to remedy the deadlock. See {@link DeadLockVictimizedException}).
 * </ol>
